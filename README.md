## Overview
### Description
A dating app that allows user to match with potential partners based on matching with other user profiles. This app will utilize a database and the swipe cards feature.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Dating
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyzes users potential matches, and connects them to other users that liked each other. The user can then decide to message this person.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their social life is, and what exactly they're looking for.
- **Scope:** We would start with pairing people based on a person liking another person's profile. Then perhaps this could evolve into a dating application that allows users to find other types of matches. For example, friends and/or business partners.
